<h1>-The Playwright Documentation provides the best way to set up your environment to run playwright tests.</h1>
        <b>https://playwright.dev/docs/intro </b>

<h1>-I used NPM and Typescript for my tests</h1>

<h1>-Once the code has been cloned, you can run the command:</h1>

       npx playwright test
This will run the tests on the different browsers, if there are failures it will open the default browser and show the reports otherwise you can run:

        npx playwright show-report
<h2>Additionally to see the UI from the video, you can run:</h2>

        npx playwright test --ui
